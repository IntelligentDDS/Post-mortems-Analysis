ORES in CODFW stopped processing requests. The result was sustained overload errors and a growing backlog of requests to process.

This is a short (<= 1 paragraph) of what happened. Please ensure to remove private information.
• March 19th
• 0400 - We observe a very high, sustained request rate from Google Cloud in SFO The sustained request rate brings EQIAD/CODFW near capacity. (grafana of external requests)
• March 20
• 15:58 DNS oresrdb.svc.codfw.wmnet is switched over to oresrdb2002
• 14:12:22 - Score cache redis start and begins loading the redis databases from disk
• 14:13:57 - the score cache redis database loads the file and start accepting connections. It also begins a full resynchronization from master
• 14:40 - Reversal of previous DNS change and forced restart of workers.
• 14:43 - ORES codfw begins to return scores again (grafana of scores processed)

Miscommunication between SRE team members ended up in the reboot of the backup redis server after it was switched to serve redis traffic.

Where is the documentation that someone responding to this alert should have (cookbook / runbook). If that documentation does not exist, there should be an action item to create it.
