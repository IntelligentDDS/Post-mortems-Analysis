ORES stopped serving requests for 3 hours because Redis ran out of disk space and the Workers could no longer function.
• Our monitoring does not catch when the webservers are up but the workers are down. We need to implement monitoring for the worker nodes.
• Our LRU policy for redis did not account for the additional disk space that would be required when using the AOF (append) persistence strategy. Switch to using RDB (snapshots)
• Phab:T121658 -- Switch from AOF to RDB persistence strategy for ORES redis
