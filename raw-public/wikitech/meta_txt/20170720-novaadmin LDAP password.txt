While on a hangout and trying to reset Coren's LDAP password, Bryan instead changed the password of the account. This broke things like Wikitech, OpenStack Keystone, and Striker that use the novaadmin account to do privileged things in LDAP. The bad password stayed in place long enough that when Bryan tried to change it back LDAP had locked the account and would not let it be changed by the user directly. Andrew was able to use the uid=admin account and credentials to change uid=novadmin's password back to the expected value.

• "Huh. It says that auth failed when I try to change your password Coren."
• "Now I can't even do a search? I must have the wrong password for novadamin."
