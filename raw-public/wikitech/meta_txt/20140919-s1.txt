At approx 2014-09-19 08:50:00 enwiki experienced a site outage. The apparent order of events was:

2. Jobrunner write activity[1] from wikiadmin user on enwiki master increased substantially, with cirrus in the spotlight:

Binlog showed substantial LinksUpdate hits (it is often in the top 10, but blends in with similar numbers to other traffic):

The job activity occurred in waves with periods of very heavy writes, then minutes of nothing.

3. enwiki slaves started to experience intermittent replication lag. The main offender was:

4. Surges of wikiuser DB connections to slaves began appearing after each write surge above in #2. These hit max_connections on all slaves simultaneously, and apaches went critical. Note that there were no slow queries involved; just an order of magnitude more connections and queries than normal.

5. Significant numbers of wikiadmin connections sat in SELECT MASTER_POS_WAIT due to #3, which reduced the available connections for #4.

6. We killed masses of wikiadmin and wikiuser sleeping connections to make way for new ones.

1. Batching the LinksUpdate DELETE and UPDATE queries would help with replag.

2. The storm of wikiuser traffic after the jobs was due to cache invalidation and presumably a lot of duplicated effort? Could that be mitigated in another layer above the DBs?

3. Can we throttle jobrunners more, or make them smarter in these situations?
