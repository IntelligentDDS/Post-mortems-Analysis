An rsyslog config change was merged, which took down swift. This caused a public partial outage on upload.wikimedia.org image fetches. About 2% of said image requests failed with 503 errors for about 15 minutes in our client response-code graphs (the rest were successful due to cache hits in varnish, presumably). dzahn restarted the swift proxies and the service recovered.

This is the 3rd time we've had the same outage - once a year in 2013, 2014, and now 2015:

Same as the last two times, still not completed.
