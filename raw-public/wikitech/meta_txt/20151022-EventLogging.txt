On Monday, October 26, 2015, we found out that data was no longer replicated for about 80 tables from m4-master to analytics-store (dbstore1002 not dbstore2002) as was visible to stat1003. All dashboards, research, etc. against these schemas (listed below) will be invalid until this data is backfilled from m4.

This was caused by schema changes done on Task T108856, combined with the replication model not using standard mysql replication, using a 3rd party script to clone data. This meant that schema changes were not replicated, and as a consequence, the copy script failed on all tables alphabetically after the first one with a different schema.

The schema change was applied to all tables and the script is backfilling slowly all rows.
• 2015-10-08 (not directly related) I delete some tables from the log schema, and I notice that the tables were recreated automatically. I am puzzled by it, but cannot do anything, as they do not reappear again. (they were being recreated by the "custom replication" process)
• 2015-10-22 15:52 A schema change is rolled on db1046. Everything seems ok after the change, but starting from that time, results may not be accurate
• 2015-10-26 14:39 milimetric informs jynus of an issue with the m4 (eventlogging) database on chat
• 2015-10-26 19:08 jynus finds the custom script failing to copy the events. Ori and others confirm its existence some minutes later. Schema is changed a few minutes after that and the script starts to backfill events from the master.
• 2015-10-27 08:24 All events are synced again with the master.
• Status: Done Document better the analytics replication model.
• Status: Done Puppetize the copy script (otherwise, it will fail on server reboot).
• Status: Done Implement better monitoring of the custom replication on db1047 and dbstore1002 . Although it can be improved by monitoring the lag, too.
