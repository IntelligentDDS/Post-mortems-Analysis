• There is a deadlock bug in PHP 5.6 which is triggered by Phabricator, leading to a deadlock in malloc as shown by this stack trace.
• The deadlock causes apache to slowly leak worker processes until the pool is filled some other system is exhausted.
• Until we can work around the bug or upgrade to a newer version of php, we will have to periodically restart apache on phabricator servers.

Explicit next steps to prevent this from happening again as much as possible, with Phabricator tasks linked for every step.
• Upgrade phabricator to PHP 7.1 as soon as it is practical to do so. phab:T160714
