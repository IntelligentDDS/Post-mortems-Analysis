Someone ran some sort of scanner script against this service, causing the backend daemon to crash twice. Service recovered on its own, total downtime ~10 mins.
• 19:48 Apparent vulnerability scan from 83.206.173.212 (212-173.206-83.static-ip.oleane.fr.) begins, about 2000 404s seen in zirconium:/var/log/apache/error.log:
• 19:54: Greg-g reports on IRC that etherpad.wikimedia.org is down, giving a "Service Temporarily Unavailable" message.
• 20:01: Service is available again
• Icinga didn't detect this outage because it only checks for a running process rather than an HTTP 200 response from port 9001. Plus since Etherpad auto-restarted, Icinga wouldn't have caught it anyway unless itchecked for a PID change.
• Etherpad is backed by db1001, no significant impact observed in Ganglia
• Unclear what HTTP response code was sent during the outage
• We are already running the newest release of Etherpad-lite, 1.4.0. No mention of security concerns from upstream https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/ (though they do have 255 issues open!), no relevant entries in CVE DB.

The above has been done. The new package 1.4.0-2 now has logrotate support and now etherpad-lite finally no longer uses console logging but logs directly to /var/log. Relevant changes are: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/151115/ and https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/151106/ . Due to the migration to upstart that was adder in the latter, downtime due to the software malfunctioning will be shorter (faster restarts by upstart)

The above has been reported in https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/issues/2215 . No reaction after 2 days
