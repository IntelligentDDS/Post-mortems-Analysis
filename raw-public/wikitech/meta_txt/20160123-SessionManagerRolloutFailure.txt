MediaWiki 1.27.0-wmf.11 reverted from all wikis due to SessionManager related problems.

MediaWiki 1.27.0-wmf.11 included the SessionManager component and related work from the AuthManager project. This set of work changed most of the PHP session handling code for MediaWiki. The code went through thorough code and security review and as much testing on the beta cluster as could be done (merged very close the prior branch cut).

A few small issues were spotted early after deployment to the group0 testing wikis but the big scary issues were not found or reported until the code started getting wider usage on the group1 (all non-wikipedia wikis) and group2 (all wikis) wikis. The majority of end user reports did not start coming in until the new code was on group2 wikis.

The most significant issue was first reported as task T124409 at 2016-01-22T12:18Z. Logging out of a user session from any wiki other than login.wikimedia.org was not clearing the session cookie on loginwiki. The active session cookie on loginwiki could be used by the CentralAuth auto-login feature which allows users to move from wiki to wiki without needing to login on each separately. Several attempts were made to correct this but ultimately reasonable time to debug and move forward with bug fixes expired before we were fully confident that the issue had been resolved. Consensus was reached at 2016-01-23T01:02 to roll back to the prior MediaWiki 1.27.0-wmf.10 release rather than leave users unable to properly logout over the weekend of 2016-01-23/24.

The core issue of the loginwiki tokens not being purged is something that could have been discovered in development testing and/or the beta cluster. Replacing major subsystems of MediaWiki should have more detailed test plans than "watch beta & prod metrics". Specifically we should have recruited and coordinated testing by developers and users inside and outside of the WMF while the code was only on the beta testing cluster.

The long tail of issues seem to be mostly related to cookie handling by various user agents. There were several changes to cache and cookie headers which seemed trivially better in code review, but turned out to be problematic when interacting with the very large and diverse set of user agents which visit the Wikimedia projects. Mass testing efforts as suggested above might help this some, but ultimately there are issues that will only be found in a high traffic environment. Some examples:

Not having TLS on the beta cluster makes it unlikely that we would have found task T124252 ("secure" flag being added to cookies returned for non-TLS requests) before group1. (task T50501)

Many of the issues didn't show up in production until 1.27.0-wmf.11 hit group1 and login wiki. Even then end user reports weren't made (or found) until after 1.27.0-wmf.11 was fully deployed. This is likely a by-product of the Wikipedia project being the most heavily used by bots, apps and end-users in general. The current group0/group1/group2 rollout process doesn't hit an extremely wide cross-section of traffic until the last step (with the possible exception of loginwiki and metawiki in group1). (task T115002)

Setting up mw1017 to run 1.27.0-wmf.11 after the 1.27.0-wmf.10 rollback has helped in debugging immensely. Separating mw1017 completely from test.wikimedia.org to make it always available for intensive debugging without disrupting testwiki usage. Ori has started a discussion on this topic.

Our current mechanism for mass expiring active sessions (CentralAuth's resetGlobalUserTokens.php) is ridiculously slow. We should really have the ability to dump all sessions in minutes rather than days. (task T124861)
