From 20:00 UTC to 22:15 UTC, jobs submitted to SGE were queued but not executed, or executed with a large delay. Around 22:15 UTC, all queued jobs had started.

Yuvipanda and valhallasw are working on phab:T123270, which required changes to the SGE configuration. This change would limit the number of concurrent jobs per user.
• 19:59:06 YuviPanda sets (max concurrent jobs per user) on gridengine to 128
• 20:02:11 valhallasw tests by submitting ~150 jobs. This doesn't cause an error, but some jobs do get into an error state. valhallasw qdels jobs.
• 20:10 valhallasw tries again, submitting ~150 jobs into the queue (which only queues and never executes for non-cyberbot). No error.
• 20:10 we figure out we are using the wrong configuration setting.
• 21:15:54 <rohit-dua> my jstart jobs is in a state of qw..(including cron) is this a labs error?

this takes a while to get noted,
• 21:33:22 <akoopal> hmm, can't get the webservice of the erwin85 tools restarted
• valhallasw checks result of and notices a lot of queues in overload state because of the number of jobs recently started. Connects this to phab:T110994
• 21:38 valhallasw suggests to reduce the "number of jobs started in the last X minutes" counter by setting load_adjustment_decay_time to something low and back to 7:30
• 21:42:44 valhallasw resets load_adjustment_decay_time to 0:7:30, as it's not having the intended effect
• 21:53:29 valhallasw notices lighttpd queues are not overloaded, but lighttpd jobs are also not starting
• 21:55:59 valhallasw sets job_load_adjustments_decay_time = 0:0:0
• this clears the list of overloaded queues, but jobs are still not scheduling
• 21:58:06 YuviPanda notes some lighttpd queues are also overloaded
• 22:05:53 valhallasw reverts config change, but this does not change anything
• 22:07:41 valhallasw removes all load adjustments by setting to and to 0:0:0. No effect.
• 22:12:30 YuviPanda restarts grid master again (maybe the configuration needs to be force-reloaded?)
• this drops the number of jobs in queue to 406, but then the number increases again
• 22:14 valhallasw qdels 2221233 and all jobs in the queue are immediately submitted
• solution was deleting the job the scheduler was confused about
• solving the issue took long because we chased a red herring (the testing we did earlier), and completely missed the information in the file

What weakness did we learn about and how can we address them?
• We are still dealing with the outfall from the Dec 30 bdb issue. We don't have enough SGE knowledge to effectively solve these issues, and learning by doing is a slow process.
• We don't have a protocol for solving an overloaded scheduler, causing us to chase that red herring for too long.

Explicit next steps to prevent this from happening again as much as possible, with Phabricator tasks linked for every step.
