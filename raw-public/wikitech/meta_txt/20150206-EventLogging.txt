EventlLogging code was dropping events sparsely from 2015-02-06 to 2015-02-10

Code seems to be working normally.
• We would benefit from looking at alarms right away and not wait several days
• More precise alarms as to what is going on wouldn't hurt
• Status: Done Make sure that log files exist for the affected period, so we can backfill.
