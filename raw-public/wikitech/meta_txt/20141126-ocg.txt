OCG (offline content generator) was not able to serve user requests (e.g. PDF versions of pages)
• 20141128T1140 user report on #wikimedia-operations about PDF generation not working, investigation begins
• 20141128T1147 disk space is suspected to be the root cause, investigation begins on that
• 20141128T1200 ocg logs on logstash indicate failure while talking to redis, investigation proceeds on that
• 20141128T1220 it is discovered that ocg configuration ships with a blank password
• There was user impact on the PDF generation starting 20141125T1537, no pages were issued
• The alarm for "ocg.svc.eqiad.wmnet" was silenced, and thus didn't fire pages
• The icinga OCG health check issue WARNING even for CRITICAL issues (e.g. returning HTTP 500, connection refused, etc)
• OCG disks were almost full, at >90% utilization
• Permanent silencing alarms for production services is discouraged, if silencing is desired for a given service the "downtime" facility is to be preferred. Downtime will auto-expire after the chosen period and thus lessen these problems.
• OCG service excessive disk utilization should be checked and automatically reclaimed (e.g. utilization thresholds or date thresholds)
