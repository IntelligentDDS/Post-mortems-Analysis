Migration of maps to upload caches resulted in query parameters being stripped, breaking some subservices (phab:T166735).

This is a step by step outline of what happened to cause the incident and how it was remedied.
• There is never enough monitoring.
• An important change was considered ops-only, was never communicated to its product team, neither beforehand for coordination nor afterwards for a quick check that everything still works.

Explicit next steps to prevent this from happening again as much as possible, with Phabricator tasks linked for every step.
• Done Add geoshapes and geolines to monitoring spec (Task T166776)
• Not done Kartographer should handle external data errors gracefully (Task T148883)
