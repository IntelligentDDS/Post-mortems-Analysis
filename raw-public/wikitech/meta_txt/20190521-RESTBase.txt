The deployment of faulty code to 2 RESTBase nodes caused empty responses to be returned to clients for some requests.

Mostly our monitoring infrastructure, very low to no impact for users.

• Pchelolo and mobrovac investigate, conclude that the issue are faulty writes to Cassandra done by RESTBase that cannot be decoded back
• 16:26 some checks recover, but not all
• 16:35 mobrovac re-issues the truncation commands, everything is back to normal

What weaknesses did we learn about and how can we address them?

The following sub-sections should have a couple brief bullet points each.

What went well?
• Automated monitoring alerted us of problems after the first two nodes (one in eqiad, one in codfw) were running the new code
• Because of the above, only a very small portion of pages that needed to be re-rendered were corrupt
• The same deployment on beta did not present any problems

Where did we get lucky?
• Automated monitoring checks detected it straightaway because some of the pages used for testing were corrupted in that brief time span

Explicit next steps to prevent this from happening again as much as possible, with Phabricator tasks linked for every step.

NOTE: Please add the #wikimedia-incident Phabricator project to these follow-up tasks and move them to the "follow-up/actionable" column.
• mobrovac did not receive any email alerts from icinga about any of this
