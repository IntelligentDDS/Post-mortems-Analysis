RCA - Network Infrastructure - East US
Summary of impact: Between 18:33 UTC and 19:08 UTC on 12 May 2017, a subset of customers may have experienced difficulties or received error notifications when connecting to resources hosted in East US. Azure Engineers detected a card failure on a backbone router servicing portions of East US. The router was removed from servicing the network. The backup device exceeded critical parameters due to previously undetected fiber damage on this device, and customers may have observed packet loss and increased latency. Customer impact: Customers may have experienced 2-5% packet loss, which would have slowed throughput and increased latency to other Azure services and the Internet in portions of East US. Azure monitoring software immediately detected this condition, and Azure Engineers repaired the failed card and placed the first router back in service to correct the condition. Root cause and mitigation: A failed line card on a network device combined with fiber damage to a second device caused customer impairment. Both issues were repaired and services were restored. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): 1. Auditing the network to ensure that fiber damage is not present in other locations. 2. Enhancing software capabilities so when line card failures occur, they are mitigated faster to avoid future a recurrence.
