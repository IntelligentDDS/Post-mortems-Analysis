RCA- Issues Performning Service Management operations - Australia East/Southeast
Summary of impact: Between 21:00 UTC on 15 Apr 2018 and 03:20 UTC on 16 Apr 2018, customers in Australia Southeast may have been unable to view resources managed by Azure Resource Manager (ARM) via the Azure Portal or programmatically and may have been unable to perform service management operations. After further investigation, customers using ARM in Australia East were not impacted by this issue. Service availability for those resources was not affected. Customer impact: Customers ability to view their existing resources was impacted. Root cause and mitigation: Customers in Australia Southeast were not able to view the resources managed by Azure Resource Manager (ARM) either through the Azure Portal or programmatically due to a bug in the storage account which only impacted ARM service availability. A storage infrastructure configuration change as part of a new deployment resulted in an authentication failure. ARM system did not recognize the failed calls to the storage account and therefore automatic failover was not executed. Engineers rolled back the configuration change in the deployment to restore successful request processing. This action negated the need for manual failover of the ARM service. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): 1. Apply the mitigation steps to all the scale units [completed] 2. Release the fix to address the storage bug [completed] 3. Update alerts and processes to detect failed storage accounts [pending] Provide feedback: Please help us improve the Azure customer communications experience by taking our survey: https://survey.microsoft.com/711121
