App Service - East Asia
Summary of impact: Between 09:32 and 09:58 UTC on 11 Oct 2018, a subset of customers using App Service in East Asia may have received HTTP 500-level response
codes and experienced timeouts or high latency when accessing App Service (Web, Mobile and API Apps) deployments hosted in this region.
Root cause: The Microsoft Azure team identified the issue was due to a dependency that the Web App service takes on Azure Storage. The application site content is hosted within Web App platform are backed by Azure Storage in a durable manner. The application accesses the site contents as file shares (this model maximizes application compatibility). Additionally, the Web App platform employs a feature to improve the impact to customers when the platform detects latency issues within the hosted primary storage volume. This is accomplished by making use of read-only (R/O) replicas (standby volumes) hosted on Azure storage. Web App Engineers collaborated with the Storage team and discovered a previously unknown issue due to regional load balancing of the storage cluster the Web App primary and secondary R/O replicas that application was hosted on.
Mitigation: This issue was detected and automatically resolved by the Azure platform's self-healing process.
Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform to help ensure
such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case it includes, but is not limited to:
â€¢ Fine tuning the self-heal mechanism to pro-actively identify changes due to load balancing and heal faster. [in progress]
