RCA - Storage - North Central US
Summary of impact: Between 17:52 UTC and 18:40 UTC on 31 Jul 2018 a subset of customers using Storage in North Central US may have experienced difficulties connecting to resources hosted in this region. Other services that leverage Storage in this region may also have been experiencing impact related to this. Root cause and mitigation: During a planned power maintenance activity, a breaker tripped transferring the IT load to its second source. A subset of the devices saw a second breaker trip resulting in the restart of a subset of Storage nodes in one of the availability zones in North Central region. Maintenance was completed with no further issues or impact to services. A majority of Storage resources self-healed. Engineers manually recovered the remaining unhealthy Storage nodes. Additional manual mitigating actions were performed by Storage engineers to fully mitigate the incident. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to):
1. Engineers have sent failed components to the OEM manufacturer for further testing and analysis [in progress]
