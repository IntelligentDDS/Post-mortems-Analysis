RCA - Managed Database services - UK South (Tracking ID TS66-1C0)
Summary of Impact: Between 09:37 and 13:54 UTC on 22 Apr 2020, a subset of customers may have seen issues affecting service management operations for Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Database Managed Instance, Azure Database for MariaDB, Azure Database for MySQL, Azure Database for PostgreSQL, Azure Database for MySQL, and Azure Synapse Analytics services in UK South. Service management operations including create, rename, update and delete may have been impacted. Connectivity to database resources was not impacted.
Root cause: Engineers determined that a manual maintenance operation impacted instances of an internal cluster data service that is responsible for receiving and executing service management operations. The primary instance of the data service became unhealthy preventing some of the service management operations from completing.
Mitigation: Engineers paused the maintenance operation and initiated failover of the data service's primary to a healthy instance, thus mitigating the issue. Engineers monitored for an extended period post-mitigation to ensure there were no further occurrences. Engineers also worked to complete the maintenance operations offline and restore all instances to operational rotation.
Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to the affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and to our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future.
Engineers will continue to review the specific maintenance operation to understand the cause of the impact, and will ensure the operation is fully automated and covered by pre- deployment test cases.
