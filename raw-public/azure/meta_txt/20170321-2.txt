RCA - Storage and Virtual Machines - West Europe 
Summary of impact: A line card failure on an Azure Networking optical system caused a loss of network capacity to the West Europe Region. During this event, customers experienced increased latency accessing their services and also sporadic packet loss. Azure Networking Engineers replaced the failed optical card to restore service. Customer impact: Virtual Machines in the West Europe Region saw increased latency and sporadic packet loss during this event. Root cause and mitigation: Due to the failure of an optical line card, network operational thresholds were reduced in West Europe. Traffic was rerouted to a redundant line card that used a different data path leading to latency across services. The faulty line card was replaced with a spare to restore full services. Next steps: We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future, and in this case, it includes (but is not limited to): 1. Operational threshold increases in the Western Europe region. 2. A redesign of the redundancy capabilities in West Europe region to reduce the probability of future occurrences.
