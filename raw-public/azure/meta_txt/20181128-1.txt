Storage - West US 2
Summary of impact: Between 04:20 and 12:30 UTC on 28 Nov 2018, a subset of Storage customers in West US 2 may have experienced difficulties connecting to resources hosted in this region. Customers using resources dependent on Storage may have also seen impact.
Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that a recent deployment task introduced an incorrect backend authentication setting. As a result, some resources attempting to connect to storage endpoints in the region experienced failures.
Mitigation: Engineers developed an update designed to refresh the incorrect authentication setting. A staged deployment of this update was then applied to the impacted storage nodes to mitigate the issue. In a small number of cases, where application of the fix was not possible, impacted nodes were removed from active rotation for further examination.
Next steps: Engineers will review deployment procedures to prevent future occurrences and a full root cause analysis will be completed.
