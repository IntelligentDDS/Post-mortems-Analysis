Azure Active Directory B2C - multiple Regions
Summary of impact: Between 19:57 and 22:05 UTC on 09 Apr 2018, customers using Azure Active Directory B2C in multiple regions may have experienced client side authorization request failures when connecting to resources. Customers attempting to access services may have received a client side error - "HTTP Error 503. The service is unavailable" - when attempting to login. Preliminary root cause: Engineers have identified a recent configuration update as the preliminary root cause for the issue. Mitigation: Engineers rolled back the recent configuration update to mitigate the issue. Some service instances had become unresponsive, and were manually rebooted so that they could pick up the change and the issue could be fully mitigated. Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
