RCA - Virtual Machines and Azure Databricks (Tracking ID 1V2C-NZ0)
Summary of Impact: Between 23:40 UTC on 29 Oct 2019 and 06:15 UTC on 30 Oct 2019, a limited subset of customers using Virtual Machines and/or Azure Databricks may have received failure notifications or experienced increased latency when performing service management operations - such as create, update, delete - for these resources.
Root Cause: An incorrect network configuration change was rolled out via an automated workflow which unintentionally targeted multiple production regions. The configuration change took effect over a period of hours, as Software Load Balancer (SLB) instances in each region were automatically restarted. Eventually, multiple Azure backend services experienced failures while attempting to establish outbound network connectivity.
Mitigation: Engineers rolled back the configuration change and manually restarted the affected SLB services to mitigate the issue.
Next Steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure
such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this included (but was not limited to):
Removing this network configuration change step in the automated workflow Adding strict validation for similar kinds of network configuration changes
