RCA - Connectivity Issues - UK South
Summary of impact: Between 06:18 UTC and 16:25 UTC on 04 July 2019, a subset of customers leveraging Storage in UK South may have experienced service availability issues. In addition, resources with dependencies on Storage may also have experienced downstream impact in the form of availability issues. These impacted services include App Services, Virtual Machines, Backup, KeyVault, App Insights, Logic Apps, and Azure Data Factory v2.
Root cause: During the last two weeks of June, the customer traffic on a single storage scale unit in the UK south region had increased more quickly than normal, and the automatic load balancing system had responded by beginning to shift load to other scale units. However, on 06:18 UTC on July 4th, 2019, the increased levels of resource utilization pushed the scale unit above its natural operating limits, which resulted in higher latency and failures. Services dependent on the storage scale unit experienced a high number of failures and latency which manifested in availability issues.
Mitigation: To recover the scale unit to healthy state, engineers applied following mitigation steps to reduce the resource utilization levels: Load balancing configuration changes
Reducing internal background processes in the scale unit
Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to):
Enhance existing load balancing and monitoring mechanism to maintain sustainable resource utilization at the storage scale unit level Improve service response to high resource utilization levels
Improve automatic load balancing efficiency to respond more quickly to an unusual increase in traffic
