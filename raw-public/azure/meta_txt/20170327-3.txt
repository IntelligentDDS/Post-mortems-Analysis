Visual Studio Team Services 
Summary of impact: Between 06:08 and 10:15 UTC on 27 Mar 2017, a subset of customers using Visual Studio Team Services in the Azure Management Portal (https://portal.azure.com) may have experienced difficulties connecting to the following services: VSTS Team Projects, Team Services, Load Testing, Team Service Accounts and Release Management - Continuous Delivery. This would have manifested in the form of continuous loading in the service blade. As a workaround, customers could continue to access these services via their Visual Studio accounts (https://accountname.visualstudio.com). More information is available at https://aka.ms/vstsblog . Preliminary root cause: Engineers identified a recent configuration change as the potential root cause. Mitigation: Engineers rolled back the recent configuration change to mitigate the issue.
