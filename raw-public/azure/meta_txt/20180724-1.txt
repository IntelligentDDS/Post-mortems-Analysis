Delays in ARM generated Activity Logs
Summary of impact: Between 23:00 UTC on 24 Jul 2018 and 07:00 UTC on 27 Jul 2018, customers may have not received activity logs for ARM resources. All service management operations for ARM resources would have been successful, however the corresponding activity logs would not have been generated. As a result, any dependent actions or workflows that are dependent on ARM generated activity logs would have not been initiated. Engineers have confirmed that customers can receive ARM generated activity logs as of 07:00 on the 27 July 2018. However, at this time customers may not able to access the activity logs that were generated during this impact time frame.  Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that a recent Azure Resource Manager deployment task impacted instances of a backend service which became unhealthy, preventing requests from completing. Mitigation: Engineers deployed a platform hotfix to mitigate the issue.  Next steps: This incident is remaining active as engineers access options for the missing logs that would have been generated during the impact window. Any customers who remains impacted will receive communications via their management portal. This is being tracked under the tracking id: FLLH-MRG.
