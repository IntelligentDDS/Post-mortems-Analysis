Backup and Site Recovery - UK South
Summary of impact: Starting at 06:10 UTC on 09 Oct 2017, engineers identified that a subset of customers using Backup and Site Recovery in UK South may have received failure notifications when performing service management operations via Powershell or the Azure Management Portal (https://portal.azure.com), for resources hosted in this region. Preliminary root cause: Engineers at this time do not have a definitive root cause but suspect that a recent deployment task impacted instances of a backend service which became unhealthy, preventing requests from completing. Mitigation: Engineers are exploring mitigation options. Next steps: This message will be closed and impacted customers will receive further communications via their Portal. Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
