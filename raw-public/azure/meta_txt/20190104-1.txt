Log Analytics - East US
Summary of impact: Between 09:30 and 18:00 UTC on 04 Jan 2019, a subset of customers using Log Analytics in East US may have received intermittent failure notifications and/or experienced latency when attempting to ingest and/or access data. Tiles and blades may have failed to load and display data. Customers may have experienced issues creating queries, log alerts, or metric alerts on logs. Additionally, customers may have experienced false positive alerts or missed alerts.
Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that a core backend Log Analytics service responsible for processing customer data became unhealthy when a database on which it is dependent became unresponsive. Initial investigation shows that this database experienced unexpectedly high CPU utilization.
Mitigation: Engineers made a configuration change to this database which allowed it to scale automatically. The database is now responsive and the core backend Log Analytics service is healthy.
Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate the reason for the high CPU utilization to establish the full root cause. Looking to stay informed on service health? Set up custom alerts here: https://www.aka.ms/ash-alerts
