Multiple Services - Central Canada 
Summary of impact: Between 16:47 and 17:20 UTC on 28 May 2017, a subset of customers in Canada Central may have intermittently experienced degraded performance, network drops or time outs when accessing their Azure resources hosted in this region. Engineers have determined that this is caused by an underlying Network Infrastructure Event in this region. Preliminary root cause: Monitoring alerted engineers of network ﬂapping through one network device. Mitigation: Engineering teams immediately removed the router from rotation and allowed trafﬁc to failover to healthy routes. Once it was established that the network trafﬁc ﬂapping had stopped, engineers brought the removed device back into rotation. Next steps: Engineers will continue to monitor the health of trafﬁc in the region and work with partners to understand the cause of the packet drops.
