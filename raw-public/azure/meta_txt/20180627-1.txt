RCA - App Service - West Europe
Summary of impact: Between 16:00 UTC on 27 Jun 2018 and 13:00 UTC on 28 Jun 2018, a subset of customers using App Service in West Europe may have received HTTP 500-level response codes, timeouts or high latency when accessing App Service (Web, Mobile and API Apps) deployments hosted in this region. Root cause and mitigation: During a recent platform deployment several App Service scale units in West Europe encountered a backend performance regression due to a modification in the telemetry collection systems. Due to this regression, customer with .NET applications running large workloads may have encountered application slowness. The root cause of this was an inefficiency in the telemetry collection pipeline which caused overall virtual machine performance degradation and slowdown. The issue was detected automatically, and the engineering team was engaged. A mitigation to remove the inefficiency causing the issue was applied at 10:00 UTC on June 28. After further review, a secondary mitigation was applied to a subset of VMs at 22:00 UTC on June 28. More than 90% of the impacted customers saw mitigation at this time. After additional monitoring, a final mitigation was applied to a single remaining scale unit at 15:00 UTC on June 29. All customers were mitigated at this time. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): • Removing the changes that caused the regression • Reviewing and if necessary adjusting the performance regression detection and alerting
