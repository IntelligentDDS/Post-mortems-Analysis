 Multiple Azure Services - Japan West - Mitigated 
 Summary of impact: Between 18:04 and 21:16 UTC on 27 Mar 2017, a subset of customers in Japan West may have experienced degraded performance, network drops or time outs when accessing their Azure resources hosted in this region. Preliminary root cause: A storage scale unit being added to the Japan West region announced routes that blocked some network connectivity between two datacenters in the region. VMs and services dependent on that connectivity would have experienced restarts or failed connections. Unfortunately, automated recovery did not mitigate the issue. The manual health checks that are conducted around all new cluster additions were performed, but did not detect a problem. This led to a delay in correct root cause analysis and mitigation. Mitigation: Engineers isolated the newly deployed scale unit, which mitigated the issue. Next steps: Investigations are currently in progress to determine exactly how incorrect routing information was configured into the storage scale unit being added and how that incorrect information escaped the many layers of validations designed to prevent such issues. A full detailed Root Cause Analysis will be published approximately in 72 hours.
