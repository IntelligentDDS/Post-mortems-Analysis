RCA - Issues logging in to the Azure Portal with a Microsoft Account
Summary of Impact: Between 21:00 UTC and 22:24 UTC on 30 Jul 2019, a subset of customers may have experienced intermittent error messages and failures when logging in to the Azure Portal with a Microsoft account. This issue affected a subset of MSA users who could not authenticate or manage their accounts. Retries may have been successful.
Root Cause: Engineers were performing standard maintenance on a standby module when the active module became unstable. It was determined that combination of factors including a device mismatch and code bug, resulted in the active device becoming unstable.
Mitigation: Engineers routed the user traffic to other redundant paths to recover the service, which restored Microsoft Account services for customers.
Next Steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our
processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to):
Updates to processes around manageability of all devices.
Improve and increase the redundancy of the supporting infrastructure, including the manageability of failed devices.
