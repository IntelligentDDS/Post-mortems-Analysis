Log Analytics - East US
Summary of impact: Between 02:47 and 13:15 UTC on 18 Mar 2017, a subset of customers using Log Analytics in East US may have received intermittent failure notifications - such as internal server errors, or tile or blade not loading - when performing log search operations. Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that a backend service responsible for processing service management requests had reached an operational threshold, preventing requests from completing. Mitigation: Engineers cleared out the service management request queues and restarted the backend service to mitigate the issue. Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
