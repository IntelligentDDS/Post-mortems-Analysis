RCA - App Service - Canada Central
Summary of impact: Between 02:45 to 3:28 UTC and 11:53 to 13:30 UTC on April 26, 2018, customers using App Service in Canada Central may have intermittently received HTTP 500-level response codes, experience timeouts or high latencies when accessing App Service deployments hosted in this region. Root cause and mitigation: The root cause for the issue was that there was a significant increase in HTTP traffic to certain sites deployed to this region. The rate of requests was so much higher than usual that it exceeded the capacity of the load balancers in that region. Load balancer throttling rules were applied for mitigation initially. However, after a certain threshold, existing throttling rules were unable to keep up with the continued increase in request rate. A secondary mitigation was applied to load balancer instances to further throttle the incoming requests. This fully mitigated the issue. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): 1. Adding aggressive automated throttling to handle unusual increases in request rate 2. Adding network layer protection to prevent malicious spikes in traffic Provide feedback: Please help us improve the Azure customer communications experience by taking our survey https://survey.microsoft.com/722407
