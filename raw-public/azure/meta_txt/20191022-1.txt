Azure Portal Sign In Failure - West Europe - Mitigated (Tracking ID 5S38-5P0)
Summary of Impact: Between 06:40 UTC and 09:54 UTC on 22 Oct 2019 a subset of customers were identified as having experienced issues signing in to the Azure Portal in West
Europe. Customers would have seen failure notifications when trying to sign in. Accessing the preview Portal here would have been successful.
Preliminary Root Cause: Engineers determined that a recent deployment task increased traffic to a backend service, in this case AAD, which in turn reached operational threshold, preventing requests from completing.
Mitigation: Engineers performed a change to the service configuration to mitigate the issue. Engineers also rolled back the recent deployment task to further mitigate the issue. Next Steps: Engineers will review deployment procedures to prevent future occurrences. Stay informed about Azure service issues by creating custom service health alerts:
