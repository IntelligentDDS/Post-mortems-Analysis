Automation - West Europe
Summary of impact: Between 07:00 and 13:39 UTC on 13 Mar 2018, a subset of customers using Automation in West Europe may have observed delays when running new or scheduled jobs in the region. Customers utilizing the update management solution may also have experienced impact. Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that instances of a backend service responsible for processing service management and scheduled jobs requests had reached an operational threshold, preventing requests from completing. Mitigation: Engineers performed a temporary change to the service configuration to downscale a back-end micro-service which mitigated the issue. All jobs are now processing, some may experience a delayed start (max. 6 hours). Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
