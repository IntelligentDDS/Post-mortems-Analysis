RCA - Networking in West US
Summary of impact: Between 22:40 UTC on 24 Oct 2018 and 00:03 UTC on 25 Oct 2018, a subset of customers may have experienced degraded network performance and/or difficulties connecting to resources in the West US region.
Root cause: A network device connecting a datacenter in the West US region experienced a fault during routine fiber maintenance. Azure Networking lost a subset of capacity between the affected data center and other facilities in the West US region. The failed network device also began silently dropping a portion of the flows that traversed it.
Mitigation: The incident was mitigated by rebalancing traffic across the remaining links. The incident was resolved via restoration of the fiber and the optical system. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our
processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. Steps specific to this incident include:
Evaluate faster link level bidirectional failure detection [in progress]
Evaluate escalated timeline for higher capacity links for this data center [in progress] Expand existing black hole detection scenarios [in progress]
Review process and validations after fiber plant maintenance [in progress]
