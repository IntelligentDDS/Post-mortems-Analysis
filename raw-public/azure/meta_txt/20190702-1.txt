Azure Services - Intermittent Service Availability Issues
Summary of Impact: Between 19:20 and 22:20 UTC on 02 Jul 2019, a subset of customers using Microsoft Azure Services may have intermittently experienced degraded performance, latency, network drops or time outs when accessing Azure resources due to a network event. This impact would have potentially spanned multiple Azure services. During the impact window, traffic peering through San Jose route would have been impacted.
Root Cause: One of the network devices in San Jose had a hardware grey failure at 19:20 UTC, causing traffic going to one of Microsoft peer networks to experience intermittent failures. This partial failure caused intermittent connectivity issues to services peered through San Jose for a subset of customers connecting through this faulty peer.
Mitigation: Engineering localized and isolated the faulty router and took the device out of service at 20:15 UTC. The traffic engineering systems immediately redirected the traffic and services started to recover. The additional load caused by the redirection out of the device was spread across multiple devices to ensure optimal latency and throughput to customers after the failure. At 22:20 UTC all traffic optimizations were completed by the automation systems, mitigating the impact.
Next Steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes:
Replaced the faulty route. [COMPLETED]
Enhanced monitoring and alerting to detect hardware grey failure. [COMPLETED]
Improve auto-mitigation logic to quickly redirect traffic across multiple devices to avoid future instances of issue. [COMPLETED] Continuing the investigation into the network router with the vendor.
