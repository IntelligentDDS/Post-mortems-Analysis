Intermittent latency in US Government Cloud - Mitigated (Tracking ID DLS5-TZ0)
Summary of impact: Between 14:00 and 17:15 EST on 04 Mar 2020, a limited subset of customers in US Gov Texas and US Gov Arizona may have experienced intermittent issues or latency connecting to resources hosted in these regions. A smaller subset of customers in other US Gov regions may have also experienced issues connecting to resources.
Preliminary root cause: After a preliminary investigation, engineers determined that a recent maintenance event on network infrastructure in the US Gov Texas region led to a shift in network traffic, causing a single network device to become congested. As this network device was responsible for routing some network traffic for other US Gov regions, some customers outside of US Gov Texas may have encountered brief periods of high latency, though most of the impact would have been to a limited number of customers with resources in US Gov Texas.
Mitigation: Engineers isolated the impacted network device and rerouted network traffic to mitigate the issue.
Next steps: We apologize for the impact to affected customers. Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
