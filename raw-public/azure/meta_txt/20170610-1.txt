Log Analytics - West Europe
Summary of impact: Between 22:50 UTC on 09 Jun 2017 and 01:20 UTC on 10 Jun 2017, customers using Log Analytics in West Europe may have experienced difÔ¨Åculties when trying to login to the OMS Portal (https://mms.microsoft.com) or when connecting to resources hosted in this region. The OMS Solutions within West Europe workspaces may have failed to properly load and display data. This includes OMS Solutions for Service Map, Insight & Analytics, Security & Compliance, Protection & Recovery, and Automation & Control offerings for OMS. Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that some instances of a backend service responsible for processing service management requests had reached an operational threshold, preventing requests from completing. Mitigation: Engineers scaled out backend instances to increase service bandwidth and mitigate the issue.
