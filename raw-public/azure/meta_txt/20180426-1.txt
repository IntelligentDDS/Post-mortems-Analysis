Traffic Manager - Connectivity Issues
Summary of impact: Between 12:46 and 18:01 UTC on 26 Apr 2018, a subset of customers using Traffic Manager may have encountered sub-optimal traffic routing or may have received alerts relating to degraded endpoints. Customers were provided a workaround during the incident. Preliminary root cause: A configuration issue with a backend network route caused issues with Traffic Manager probes reaching customer endpoints while checking the endpoint health status which led to those endpoints being marked as unhealthy and traffic routed away from them. Mitigation: Engineers made mapping updates to the network route which mitigated the issue. Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
