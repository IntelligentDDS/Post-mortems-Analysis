RCA - Networking - UK West
Summary of impact: Between 03:30 and 12:25 UTC on 14 Dec 2018, a subset of customers with resources in UK West may have intermittently experienced degraded performance, latency, network drops or time outs when accessing Azure resources hosted in this region. Customers with resources in UK West attempting to access resources outside of the region may have also experienced similar symptoms.
Root cause: Engineers determined that an external networking circuit experienced a hardware failure impacting a single fiber in this region. A single card on the optical system that services this fiber path had developed a fault, and this reduced the available network capacity, thus causing network issues for a subset of customers.
Mitigation: Azure Engineers initially re-directed internal Azure traffic to free up capacity for customer traffic, and this mitigated the issues being experienced by customers. Engineers subsequently performed a full hardware replacement which restored full connectivity across the fiber circuit, thus completely mitigating the issue.
Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to):
Augmenting critical networking paths to UK West with 400Gb of additional capacity. 50% of this work is already now complete, and the remaining work is scheduled to be completed by end of February 2019.
Updating our monitoring to ensure we are able to respond quicker to external networking issues, and thus reduce the impact time for customers.
