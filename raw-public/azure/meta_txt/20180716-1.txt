RCA - Networking - Service Availability
Summary of impact: Between 14:55 and 16:15 UTC on 16 July 2018, a subset of Azure customers in West US, West Central US, India South, India Central, and Australia East may have experienced difficulties connecting to Azure endpoints, which in-turn may have caused errors when accessing Microsoft Services in the impacted regions. Root cause and mitigation: Azure utilizes the industry standard Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) to advertise network paths (routes) for all Azure services. As part of the monthly route prefix update process for ExpressRoute, a misconfigured ExpressRoute device began advertising a subset of Microsoft routes which conflicted with the Microsoft global network. All traffic destined for the public endpoints via these routes either externally or from within an impacted region could not reach their destination. This included Azure Virtual Machines and other services with a dependence on impacted Azure storage accounts. Engineers responded to the alerts, identified the cause of the routing anomaly, and isolated the portion of the network to mitigate the issue. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): 1. Enhanced configuration validation at the time of deployment and automatic detection of configuration anomalies post deployment – in progress 2. Monitoring and alerting of incorrect route advertisement into the Microsoft global network for faster identification and mitigation – in progress 3. Enforce network route protection to ensure that route advertisements are more limited in scope and radius – in progress Provide feedback: Please help us improve the Azure customer communications experience by taking our survey: https://aka.ms/YY0R-NS8 (https://aka.ms/YY0R-NS8)
