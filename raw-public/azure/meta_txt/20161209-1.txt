Virtual Machines (v2) - South Central US 
Summary of impact: Between approximately 20:00 UTC on 08 Dec 2016 and 00:47 UTC on 09 Dec 2016, customers using Virtual Machines (v2) in South Central US may have experienced failure notifications when attempting to perform networking-related update operations (such as network interfaces, NAT rules, or load balancing) to existing Virtual Machine (v2) configurations. This only affected networking-related operations on Virtual Machines (v2) as all other service management operations (such as Start, Stop, Create, Delete) on all Virtual Machines were fully functional. Preliminary root cause: A software error on a recent deployment was determined as the underlying root cause. Mitigation: Engineers created a new software build and deployed the update to mitigate. Next steps: Engineers will continue to monitor for operational stability and take steps to prevent future recurrences on deployments.
