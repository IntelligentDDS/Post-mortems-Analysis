Automation - East US 2
Summary of impact: Between 11:00 and 16:15 UTC on 07 Jun 2017, a limited subset of customers using Automation in East US 2 may have experienced intermittent issues viewing accounts, schedules, assets or starting jobs in the Azure Portal (https://portal.azure.com). Any clients using APIs would have also been impacted, such as PowerShell or SDKs. Jobs which were already submitted would have seen a delayed execution and would have eventually been processed. These start operations should not have been resubmitted. This issue could have impacted up to 3% of customers in the region. Preliminary root cause: Engineers identiﬁed a query that consumed CPU resources on a single backend database, which impacted other queries from completing successfully. Mitigation: Engineers performed a failover to a secondary database to start with fresh resources and optimized conﬁgurations on the offending query. Next steps: Engineers will continue to optimize query conﬁgurations and investigate the underlying cause to prevent future occurrences.
