Azure Data Lake Store/Data Lake Analytics - North Europe
Summary of impact: Between 08:00 and 13:39 UTC on 29 Nov 2018, a subset of customers using Azure Data Lake Store and/or Data Lake Analytics may have experienced difficulties accessing resources hosted in this region. Data ingress or egress operations may have also timed-out or failed. Azure Data Lake Analytics customers may have experienced job failures. In addition, customers using other services with dependencies upon Azure Data Lake Store resources in this region - such as Databricks, Data Catalog, HDInsight and Data Factory - may also have experienced downstream impact.
Preliminary root cause: A scheduled power maintenance in a datacenter in North Europe resulted in a small number of hardware instances becoming unhealthy. As result of this, Data Lake Store resources hosted on the impacted hardware became temporarily unavailable to customers.
Mitigation: The power maintenance task was cancelled and the impacted hardware was restarted. This returned the affected services hosted on this hardware to a healthy state, mitigating the impact for customers.
Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause of why the power maintenance task failed and prevent future occurrences.
