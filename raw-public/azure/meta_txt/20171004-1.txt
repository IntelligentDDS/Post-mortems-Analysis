Azure Cloud Shell - authentication Issues
Summary of impact: Between 02:30 and 08:30 UTC on 04 Oct 2017, a subset of customers using Cloud Shell may have experienced the following authentication error when running Azure CLI command: "A Cloud Shell credential problem occurred. When you report the issue with the error below, please mention the hostname 'host-name'. Could not retrieve token from local cache." Preliminary root cause: From initial investigations, engineers suspect that there was an issue with the cloud shell images used in the backend to provision this service, which were causing logins to take longer than normal. Mitigation: Engineers redeployed the Cloud Shell images with a newer image, which was verified as not having the same symptoms, to mitigate the issue. Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences
