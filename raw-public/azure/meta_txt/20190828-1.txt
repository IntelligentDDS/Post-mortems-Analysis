Azure Email Alerts - Mitigated
Summary of impact: Between 20:22 UTC on 28 Aug 2019 and 01:35 UTC on 29 Aug 2019, a subset of customers may not have received email alerts sent from a subset of Azure services during the impact window.
Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that instances of a backend email processing service became unhealthy during platform maintenance. This prevented requests from completing successfully, causing impact to downstream services.
Mitigation: Engineers halted the maintenance and validated the service health to mitigate the issue.
Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences. Stay informed about Azure service issues by creating
