RCA - USGov Virginia - Service Availability
Summary of impact: Between 07:38 and 09:50 EST on 27 Feb 2019, a subset of customers may have experienced degraded performance or timeouts while accessing
Azure resources.
Root cause: During routine electrical equipment maintenance at a datacenter, the equipment responsible for load transfer to our redundant power source failed, causing temporary power loss to a subset of racks and devices within the US Virginia data center. This resulted in cascading impact to dependent Azure services.
During this event, a STS (static transfer switch) failed during a load transfer causing the load to rapidly shift back to its primary source, tripping a circuit breaker to prevent damage to the equipment. The dual failure resulted in a drop in power to both feeds powering the server equipment in part of the data center.
Mitigation: Site engineers were able to bring up the redundant power system and restore power to the affected racks and devices while repairs were made to the defective component, which was then brought back online. Recovery to dependent services was done so manually, and engineers subsequently confirmed mitigation once connectivity was fully restored. Engineers actively monitored the restoration process, and full service restoration was confirmed at 09:50 EST, although most services would have recovered before this time.
Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. This includes, but is not limited to:
Review the pre-checks and validation used on electrical equipment prior to any maintenance and add steps to validate the equipment functionality [in progress] Provide feedback: Please help us improve Azure customer communications experience by taking our survey https://aka.ms/W59G-LRG
