RCA - IoT Hub - Connectivity Issues
Summary of impact: Between 01:30 UTC on 01 Jul 2018 and 18:00 UTC on 02 Jul 2018, a subset of customers using Azure IoT Hub in West Europe, North Europe, East US, and West US may have experienced difficulties connecting to resources hosted in these regions. Customer impact: During the impact, symptoms may have included failures when creating IoT Hub, connection latencies, and disconnects in the impacted regions. Root cause and mitigation: A subset of IoT Hub scale units experienced a significant increase in load due to high volume of operational activity and recurring import jobs across multiple instances, which ultimately throttled the backend system. The issue was exacerbated as the loads were unevenly distributed across the clusters. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): 1. Optimize throttling of queries to prevent system load – In Progress  2. Fine-tune load balancing algorithm to provide quicker detection and alerting – In Progress 3. Improve failover strategy to quickly mitigate – In Progress Provide feedback: Please help us improve the Azure customer communications experience by taking our survey https://aka.ms/V8BX-PW8 (https://aka.ms/V8BX-PW8)
