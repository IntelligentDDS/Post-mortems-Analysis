Log Analytics - Data Processing in East US
Summary of impact: Between approximately 08:00 and 19:00 UTC on 02 Mar 2018, customers using Log Analytics in East US may have been unable to view recently uploaded analytics data. Data has processed slower than expected due to a data ingestion queue backlog. Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that some backend instances became unhealthy, preventing analytics data from processing and creating a backlog. Mitigation: Engineers made a configuration change and restarted backend instances to mitigate the issue. Next steps: Engineers continue to monitor the backlog which is currently decreasing. Customers who continue to be impacted with this ingestion delay will be communicated to within the Azure Portal.
