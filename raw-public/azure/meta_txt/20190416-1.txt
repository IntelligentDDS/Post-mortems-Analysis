RCA - Networking Degradation - Australia Southeast / Australia East
Summary of impact: Between 07:12 and 08:02 UTC on 16 Apr 2019, a subset of customers with resources in Australia Southeast / Australia East may have
experienced difficulties connecting to Azure endpoints, which in-turn may have caused errors when accessing Microsoft Services in the impacted regions.
Root cause: Microsoft received automated notification alerts that the Australia East and Australia Southeast regions were experiencing degraded network availability from a select number of Internet Service Providers (ISPs). During this time, a subset of network prefix paths changed for the select number of ISPs, this manifested in traffic not reaching the destinations within the Australia East and Australia Southeast regions. The issue stemmed from a routing anomaly due to an erroneous advertisement of prefixes received via an ExpressRoute circuit to an Internet Exchange (IX).
Mitigation: Microsoft disabled the incorrect ExpressRoute peering. The IX also identified a high amount of traffic and automatically mitigated by bringing down the peering with the IX. Once the peerings were brought down by Microsoft and the IX, availability was restored to Australia East and Australia Southeast regions.
Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to):
Engage Internet Service Providers to add additional policies/protections to Internet facing routing infrastructure to block future routing anomalies [Complete] Add additional automated route mitigation steps within the Azure platform to reduce mitigation time [In Progress]
Investigate further route optimizations in the Azure/Microsoft ecosystem to inherently block future routing anomalies [In Progress]
