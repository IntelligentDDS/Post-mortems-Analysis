Service Bus - West Europe
Summary of impact: Between approximately 12:00 and 14:44 UTC on 19 Apr 2018, a subset of customers using Service Bus in West Europe may have experienced intermittent timeouts or errors when connecting to Service Bus queues and topics in this region. Preliminary root cause: This issue is related to a similar issue that occurred on the 18th of April in the same region. Engineers determined that the underlying root cause was a backend service that had become unhealthy on a single scale unit, causing intermittent accessibility issues to Service Bus resources. Mitigation: While the original incident self-healed, engineers have additionally performed a change to the service configuration to reroute traffic from the affected scale unit to mitigate the issue. In addition, a manual backend scale out was performed. Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
