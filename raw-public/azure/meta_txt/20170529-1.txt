IoT Hub – Error message when deploying
Summary of impact: Between 00:00 UTC on 26 May 2017 and 16:30 UTC on 29 May 2017, a subset of customers using Azure IoT Hub may have received the error message "Cannot read property 'value' of undeﬁned or null reference" when trying to deploy IoT Hub resources. This issue only affected new subscriptions attempting to deploy their ﬁrst IoT Hub - existing IoT Hubs were not affected. Customers could deploy IoT Hubs using Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates as a workaround. Preliminary root cause: Engineers determined that a recent deployment introduced a new software task that was not properly validating new subscriptions. Mitigation: Engineers deployed a platform hotﬁx to bypass this software task and mitigate the issue. Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
