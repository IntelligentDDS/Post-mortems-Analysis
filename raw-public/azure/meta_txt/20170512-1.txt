Virtual Machines - North Europe
Summary of impact: Between 09:07 UTC on 11 May 2017 and 03:02 UTC on 12 May 2017, a subset of customers in North Europe may have received intermittent allocation failure notifications when attempting to provision new D-series V2 Virtual Machines. Customers with existing D-Series V2 Virtual Machines may have also experienced failures when attempting to perform scaling or resizing operations. This issue did not impact the availability of existing Virtual Machines. Preliminary root cause: Engineers identified a backend service which had reached an operational threshold. Mitigation: Engineers repaired the unhealthy back end service and took extra steps to improve operational thresholds. Next steps: Engineers will continue to investigate to establish the full root cause and prevent future occurrences.
