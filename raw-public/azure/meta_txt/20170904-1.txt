RCA - ExpressRoute / ExpressRoute Circuits - Washington DC
Summary of impact: Between approximately 09:07 and 14:56 UTC on 04 Sep 2017, a subset of customers using ExpressRoute Services with circuits terminating in the Washington DC region may have experienced difficulties connecting to Microsoft Azure resources, Dynamics 365 services or Office 365 services. Customers with backup Express Route Service circuits in other regions or with internet failover paths should not have been impacted. Customers using Azure Virtual Network services were not impacted during this time. Customer impact: Connectivity between customer sites and Microsoft Express Route Service Endpoints was interrupted in the Washington DC region. Workaround: Customers with a failover path would not have been impacted. More information can be found here: aka.ms/s3w930 Root cause and mitigation: A routine maintenance was being conducted on the Microsoft Network in the Washington DC area. As part of the change, a legacy configuration was applied that did not include required routing policy statements. As a result, multiple routes in the Washington DC location were withdrawn, which resulted in the connectivity failures. Next steps: We sincerely apologize for the impact to affected customers. We are continuously taking steps to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): Standard Operational Procedures (SOP) updated for this class of change world-wide including health validation signals at time of change; Additional rigor applied to SOP reviews and changes; and ExpressRoute Engineering will be adding monitoring to generate alerts on all routes that are withdrawn.
