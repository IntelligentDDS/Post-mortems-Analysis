# Google Cloud Console Incident #19001

We've received a report of an issue with Google Cloud Console.

Incident began at **2019-03-11 09:58** and ended at **2019-03-11 16:31** (all
times are **US/Pacific** ).

ISSUE SUMMARY

On Monday, 11 March 2019, Google Cloud Console was unavailable for a duration
of 3 hours and 54 minutes. Although, Google Cloud Platform resources remained
unaffected, we understand that a majority of our customers rely on Cloud
Console to manage their cloud resources and we sincerely apologize to everyone
who was affected by the incident. The issue also affected Firebase console and
IAM service account activations.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF IMPACT

On Monday, 11 March 2019, from 09:26 to 13:20 US/Pacific, Cloud Console was
unavailable. Users were unable to access and manage their GCP resources using
Cloud Console. All Google Cloud Platform resources continued to function and
were accessible using the gcloud CLI, and the Cloud Console iOS and Android
apps. From 14:10 to 15:37 US/Pacific, for a duration of 1 hour 27 minutes,
Firebase Console and IAM service account activation were also unavailable to
users.

ROOT CAUSE

Most Google services use a quota system for rate limiting user requests. The
quota system implements a variant of the classic token bucket algorithm [1].

The issue was triggered when a code change in the most recent release of the
quota system introduced a bug, causing a fallback to significantly smaller,
default quota limits, resulting in user requests being denied.

While the Cloud Console team mitigated the issue at 13:20 US/Pacifc, the
underlying issue with the quota system started affecting Firebase Console and
IAM service account activation beginning 14:10 US/Pacific until it was
mitigated at 15:37 US/Pacific.

REMEDIATION AND PREVENTION

Cloud Console engineers were alerted at 09:31 US/Pacific and began
investigation shortly after. The issue was mitigated at 13:20 US/Pacific when
quota server engineers granted additional quota to Cloud Console while they
continued to investigate the root cause. The issue was permanently mitigated
when the offending change was rolled back.

In addition to fixing the underlying bug, we will be fixing the error in our
default quota configuration. We will also be improving our automated alerts
system to cover obviously erroneous quota denials.

We apologize again for the inconvenience caused by this issue to our
customers.

Mitigation work is currently underway by our Engineering Team. We will provide
another status update by Monday, 2019-03-11 12:15 US/Pacific with current
details.

Affected users may receive a "failed to load" error message when attempting to
list resources like Compute Engine instances, billing accounts, GKE clusters,
and Google Cloud Functions quotas.

As a workaround, the gcloud SDK can be used instead of the Cloud Console.
