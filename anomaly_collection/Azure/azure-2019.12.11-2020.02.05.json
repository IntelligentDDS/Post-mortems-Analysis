A recent change to Verizon's deployment pipeline introduced a latent bug that caused some deployment service health notifications to provide incorrect health status. While Verizon was performing maintenance to resolve a delay in a separate configuration deployment, an improperly encoded configuration file was deployed to production. Due to the aforementioned bug which caused latency in their service health notifications, the regular safety features in their deployment process did not trigger, and allowed the improper configuration to reach global PoPs. This configuration caused service instability across the their global PoPs and resulted in customers receiving HTTP errors (5XX) or connection errors when attempting to reach Azure CDN from Verizon endpoints. Verizon's monitoring caught this issue immediately however, and teams were engaged to resolve the issue. Upon Verizon mitigating the issue, Microsoft services were restored to a healthy state. Mitigation: After determining the root cause to be the improperly encoded configuration file, a new hotfix was developed and deployed globally.

We are continuously taking steps with our partners to improve the Microsoft Azure Platform and our processes to help ensure such incidents do not occur in the future. In this case, this includes (but is not limited to): Review all service change management processes and practices to ensure that all health check mechanisms are monitored and interact correctly with deployment staging. Add additional validation to maintenance and deployment practices to ensure all configuration deployment paths result in valid configuration.

A software update on the SWAN (Software enabled Wide Area Network)—Microsoft's backbone network that connects large data center regions together—caused the router forwarding tables to become mis-programmed.",
        "details": "Root Cause: From 21:03 UTC, the SWAN network was unable to generate and program a working Forwarding Information Base (FIB) into the SWAN routers due to a bad configuration push. Incompatible FIB pushes that caused failure on part of the routers resulted in FIB rollbacks. The incompatible FIB push caused all traffic engineering tunnels on the routers to go down, which made traffic go on the shortest path and resulted in congestion drops in the network of around 10% of traffic. Mitigation: When the incompatible FIB was rolled back to the last known good state, Traffic Engineering worked again, and drops subsided. However, the non-working FIB continued to get generated, and its install/rollback kept causing drops until the configuration change was rolled back. Rollback of the configuration change was slow due to safeguards built into the system. The configuration problem was finally rolled back at 22:28 UTC, completely resolving the traffic drops.
